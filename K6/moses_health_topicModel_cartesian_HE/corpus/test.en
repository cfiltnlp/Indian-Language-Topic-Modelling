Besides the above general symptoms , complaints of bleeding from teeth , mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox . 
Tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than 1 lac on blood test . 
Dengue fever occurs after a sting of aedes aegypti . 
Aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time . 
Do not keep water collected at home in coolers , in tanks on root , empty disused tin cans , in tyres , in flower pots , in empty bottles , money plants , bottles and cisterns . 
Keep the water in coolers , tubs , pitchers at home changing twice a week . 
Do not let water collect near home . 
Fill the ditches with soil . 
If filling with soil is not possible , spray kerosene oil etc . in the ditch . 
Use neem oil or mustard oil over body . 
Use full sleeve shirts and socks . 
You must get boys / girls wear full sleeve clothes and socks when they are going to school . 
Get insecticides sprayed at home . 
Keep the environment clean at home and nearby . 
Get treatment during the disease outburst , on coming of fever at the government hospital / primary health centre . 
You must use mosquito nets or anti - mosquito incense sticks while sleeping . 
You must install nets on windows , doors and clerestorys
Non - steroidal drugs should not be taken in dengue fever . 
Diabetes is such a kind of disease as a result of which sugar / glucose becomes very high in blood . 
Diabetes is a serious disease which , if not controlled , can be killing . 
On being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar . 
Sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin . 
If you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes . 
Frequent feeling of urination . 
Feeling more thirsty and dim vision . 
Physical inability in sexual activities . 
Numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them . 
Problems occurring from diabetes . 
The following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes . 
Excess of sugar in blood , long term complexities . 
Damage to tendons or neuropathy . 
Damage to kidney or nephropathy . 
Damage to eyes or retinopathy . 
Disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels . 
Long term complexities of diabetes . 
damage to tendons : diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands . 
Shivering , numbness , inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards . 
If treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs . 
Damage to kidney : Delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required . 
Diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness . 
Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur . 
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes . 
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this . 
Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion . 
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle . 
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre - damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests . 
Every disease occurs due to a type of virus . 
Virus is so small that they cannot be seen through common microscope . 
If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person . 
After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person . 
Usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes - 
High fever . 
Acute pain . 
Stiffness in neck . 
Stiffness in body . 
Strokes in body . 
Nausea and vomiting . 
Fainting or total nervousness . 
As soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health centre , sub - divisional government hospital or district hospital . 
Malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community . 
Disease carrying mosquitoes mainly reside outside home in paddy fields , ponds and ditches filled with water . 
Pay special attention towards cleanliness at home and outside . 
Fill the ditches , cut tall grass and bushes . 
Wear pants , pyjama , dhoti , socks , full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening . 
Use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible . 
Do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house . 
Cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging . 
Use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties . 
Get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time . 
Hepatitis - A is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world . 
This occurs due to Hepatitis - A virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness . 
Virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients . 
Hepatitis - A viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage . 
The virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious . 
Therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops . 
Nausea / vomiting , jaundice , purge , light coloured faeces , stomach ache , weakness , tiredness , fever , shivering , not feeling hungry , neck pain etc . 
Symptoms are dependent on the frequency / intensity of emergence . 
Hepatitis - A and V are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses . 
Every type of hepatitis is different . 
Hepatitis - A cannot be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis - B . 
Similarly , hepatitis - B cannot be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis - A . 
The vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitis - A . 
Primary vaccination keeps a person safe for a year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about 20 years . 
A combined vaccine is available from Glaxosmithkline which provides safety from , both hepatitis - A and hepatitis - B through a single safety order administered at 0 , 1 , 6 months . 
The combined vaccine of hepatitis - A and hepatitis - B is available in two forms . 
Paediatric dose : One dose is of 0 . 5 ml for children and adolescents . 
Adult dose : The dose is of 1 . 0 ml for adults of the age of 16 years and above . 
Hepatitis - B is a worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitis - B virus ( HBV ) . 
HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs . 
The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted . 
The results of infection are different and unexpected . 
The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system . 
Hepatitis - B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV . 
In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis - B victimises more people to death in the whole year . 
Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis - B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included . 
HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person . 
The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis - B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination . 
After vaccination people who have developed protective anti - bacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases . 
With extensive use of hepatitis - B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis - B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis - B . 
Yellow fever is also called yellow jack , black vomit , Negro ' s vomit or American Plague . 
The combined vaccine is made for children and adults . 
What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again ? 
The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence . 
The family welfare programme was run at the national level in the year of 1952 . 
On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo ( Egypt ) in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare . 
All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services . 
Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born . 
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India . 
This programme has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state . 
Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh . 
Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951 - 1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976 - 1981 and during the years of 1994 - 2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only . 
Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar . 
Gross reproduction rate ( the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time ) which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971 - 76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3 . 3 . 
Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period . 
Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas . 
It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state . 
Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas . 
About one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within 24 months . 
A little less than half of the mothers ( 46 percent ) give birth to more than 3 kids . 
About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger . 
It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular . 
According to the estimates of Sample Registration System ( S . R . S . ) the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9 . 
The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate ( 68 / 1000 ) . 
Two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself . 
Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births . 
Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available . 
Considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high . 
Non - communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization . 
The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate . 
This programme is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme , to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women , to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies . 
The goal of health programmes is to increase the rate of parent security to 49 . 0 percent till 2006 , 55 . 0 percent till 2010 , and 95 percent till 2020 . 
The rate of childbirth security to 60 percent till 2006 , 80 percent till 2010 and institutional childbirths has increased to the maximum . 
Main works under the Reproductive and Child Health Programme . 
Main works being run under the programme are as follows . 
Organisation of R . C . H . camps . 
Organisation of R . C . H . Outdoor sessions . 
Appointment of women health workers on contract . 
Comprehensive construction work and repairing / renovation of health units
Urban Reproductive and Child Health Programme
Appointment of supplementary A . N . M . on contract . 
Appointment of 258 supplementary A . N . M . on contract basis in the unserved and rural areas has been made to increase the immunisation of mothers and children and the acceptability of contraceptives . 
On the directions of the Government of India service is being made available at 39 PHCs and 26 CHCs with the goal to provide secure childbirth from 8 o ' clock at night to 7 o ' clock in the morning at PHCs and CHCs . 
900 untrained midwives have been trained in Uttarakhand in the year of 2001 - 2002 and 2002 - 03 to provide services of safe labour to pregnant mothers . 
560 untrained midwives have been trained in the year of 2004 - 2005 . 
5 Safe Maternity Counsellors ( Women Medical Officer ) were accepted to be appointed by the Government of India on a contract basis under the E . A . G . scheme . 
After the advertisements in newspapers for appointment three women medical officers were selected out of which only 1 women medical officer has reported her contribution at Agastyamuni CHC of district Rudraprayag . 
Care of the health of women and children and vaccination is being done on a village council level by organising an Outreach Session on a defined day ( Saturday ) by women health workers at the level of each village council in the state . 
The said programme has been scrapped by the Govt . of India since July , 2004 . 
But the above mentioned programme is being run in the state with the help of women health workers . 
Medicines are being bought at the state level under the RCH programme . 
RCH kits are being provided directly to the districts by the Government of India . 
For equipments bought at the level of the state the provision is to purchase after the recommendation of the Executive Committee constituted at the state level by the Purchase Committee constituted at the level of the Head Office . 
Special work has been done in districts in the year of 2003 - 2004 for propagation of NSV ( without cut , without stitch ) method to increase the participation men in population stabilisation . 
Population stabilisation , installation of stable RN hoarding , wall paintings , orientation of the members of the Panchayati Raj and medical and paramedical staff from the medical department and other media exhibition etc . were done . 
Leprosy is a bacteria born contagious disease . 
The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae . 
Microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin . 
Incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly . 
Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally . 
The M . D . T . medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society . 
All the leprosy patients are not contagious . 
Most of the patients are non - contagious who cannot spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious . 
Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles , T . B . etc . 
About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease cannot happen to them . 
The main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows . 
A light yellow or discoloured reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness , i . e . the spot has no feeling of pain , inflammation , itching or piercing or cold and hot . 
Oily shine on the skin . 
Thickness of cyst on skin , eyebrows , chin , ears . 
Do not do any hard work for three months after the operation of hernia . 
Thrilling sensation , numbness or dryness in hands or feet . 
Occurrence of deformation in the fingers of hands or feet . 
Initiation and spread of leprosy . 
Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb . 
If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication . 
If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing . 
Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly . 
Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage . 
Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients . 
Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment cannot be brought back to the previous state through medicines . 
Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood . 
Malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito . 
Female anopheles mosquitoes get born in clean water and bites at night . 
Fever along with shivering and cold comes often the third day . 
You must change water collected in pots at home once a week . 
Use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard / neem oil on open parts of the body . 
Install fine nets on windows / doors / clerestories of house . 
Do not let water collect near yourself . 
If this is not possible then pour some petro - lubricants / diesel / kerosene oil on the collected water . 
The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent . 
Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible . 
Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months . 
Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin . 
Besides this , loose motion , stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction . 
In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10 - 12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period . 
During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well . 
After this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease . 
The period between the entrance of the bacteria / virus and the start of the disease . 
Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining . 
Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth . 
Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps . 
Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths . 
Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while . 
The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules . The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children . 
About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly . 
When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened . 
Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR . 
MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine . 
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective . 
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life . 
Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy . 
However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme . 
The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles . 
Therefore now it is recommended by both W . H . O . and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles . 
Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel . 
Such a system of brain is called mental disorder . 
It is estimated that 1 - 2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease . 
It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill . 
Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality . 
Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease . 
Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries . 
It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up . 
Not paying attention to any work . 
Being sad without any reason . 
Getting angry very soon , very often . 
Change in mood very soon , being sorry from happiness and getting happy again . 
Getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children . 
Thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong . 
Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana . 
Problem in desire or the process of copulation . 
Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his / her total mental agony is seen ( in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him / her can be seen ) and then his / her physical and mental test is done . 
If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done . 
Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods . 
Listening to the patient and his / her family and providing information about his / her mental health . 
Encouraging the patient to change emotionally . 
Making people aware by propagating for mental health through press , T . V . , radio , health fairs , posters , banners etc in every district . 
Making social environment better , encouraging participation and social relations among people in the society . 
Finding out about the mental , social and personality change since the start . 
Running tests in schools , colleges , government and non - government institutes . 
Treating emotional and mental disorders , enabling families to undergo difficult situations . 
Solving the social and personal problems of the patient . 
Treating the mental patient and lessening the difficulty of the family and society . 
Saving a mental patient from falling ill again . 
The following is be executed in the state under the mental health programme . 
State Mental Health Authority has been constituted in the state since 4 April , 2002 . 
A 30 bed State Mental Hospital is being constructed at Dehradun under the Mental Health Authority programme . 
Two districts of Uttarakhand have been chosen under the District Mental Health Programme . 
Dehradun in the Garhwal division and Nainital in the Kumaun division . 
For which a proposal of 184 . 30 lac has been sent to the Government of India . 
This programme will be implemented in both the districts of Dehradun and Nainital . 
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme has been transferred from Social Welfare Department to Health Welfare Department since 14 . 9 . 2001 by the Government of India . 
The process of transfer is now complete . 
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme is being implemented by the Health Department in the state of Uttarakhand . 
Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs . 500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition . 
The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows . 
The following programmes are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services . 
A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre - delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level . 
The percentage of the women getting the pre - delivery test done thrice is only 18 . 
There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre - delivery services in the urban and the rural areas . 
More than three fourth of the women ( 78 percent ) in the urban areas gets the pre - delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so . 
A little more than one third ( 39 percent ) of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills . 
In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T . T . , however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent . 
Generally there is much less vogue of pre - delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service - 
Indicating pregnant women . 
Distribution of pills to prevent anaemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases . 
There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand . 
This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labour occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives . 
Even in urban areas more than half ( 56 percent ) of childbirths takes place at home . 
In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives . 
Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth ( 14 percent ) is benefitted with post - labour tests within two months . 
Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post - childbirth services . 
Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin - A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion . 
A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001 - 2002 , 2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 has been shown in the following table . 
The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans . 
This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person . 
However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth . 
Polio disease particularly attacks young children . 
80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age . 
Polio is an extremely contagious disease . 
Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities . 
Oral Poliovirus Vaccine ( OPV ) was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union . 
As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries . 
The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world . 
The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful . 
Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help . 
By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis . 
Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose . 
Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less . 
Sex related diseases are contagious diseases . This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one ' s sex partner during sexual intercourse . 
This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy . 
Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy . 
Sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful . 
The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia . 
Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment . 
Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all . 
Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he / she can infect his / her sexual partner or unborn children . 
Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen ( between naval and the reproductive organs ) . 
Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women . 
Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting . 
Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs . 
If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them . 
Dead birth due to inborn syphilis . 
The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases . 
Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction . 
Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye . 
Contracted sexual behaviour is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease . 
The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease . 
Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs . 
Keep away from uncommon sexual relations . 
Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse . 
HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases . 
It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities . 
Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behaviour is not followed . 
Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment . 
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease . 
Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis . 
The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex . 
A tuberculosis patient can infect 10 - 15 persons in a year . 
About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases . 
Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes . 
This disease is found commonly in the lungs . 
In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease . 
Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much . 
The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much . People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done . 
In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis . 
According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year . 
The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India . 
Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac . 
In comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in India . 
The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined . 
This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis . 
In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times . 
Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy . 
Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis ( of the lungs ) . 
The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm . 
The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing . 
The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis . 
Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X - ray is also used if necessary . 
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested . 
Tuberculosis can be completely cured . 
If the patient does the treatment regularly . 
There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment . 
Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy . 
In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers . 
Which is called DOTS ( Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy ) . 
As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti - tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker . 
There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis . 
Intensive phase which goes on for 2 - 3 months . 
Continuation phase is of 4 - 5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking . 
Under this programme these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2 - 3 months ( intensive phase ) . 
After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti - tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi - blistered combo pack . 
Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker . 
During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete . 
You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase . 
The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient cannot infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test . 
Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease . 
Yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics . 
Yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae . 
Arbovirus is a gram positive single - formula RNA virus . 
Like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva . 
The mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni , aedes africanus and aedes aegypti .
